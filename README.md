## What the notebooks contain

`run_train` is an example of running the `train.py` script.

`results` plots training loss and t-SNE plots for different hyperparameter configurations.

`inference` contains the function `retrieve_top_k`, which, given a model and query image, plots the k images having embeddings closest to the query embedding.
